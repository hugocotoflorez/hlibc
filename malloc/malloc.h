/* Info about low level mechanisms
 *
 * Page:
 * Pages are raw chunks of data recived thow a mmap() call.
 * It contains a page header (page_t) at the LSB byte.
 * Remaining block space can be one of the following entries.
 *
 * Node:
 * A node (node_t) is the structure that store info
 * about a free block. It is placed just before the
 * free block.
 *
 * Header:
 * A header (header_t) that contains info about reserved memory.
 * After the header start an used block.
 *
 * Free block.
 * Data or nothing that is not allocated neither used
 * by any header. Just before this block there are a
 * node (node_t).
 *
 * Used block.
 * Data that where allocated. Just before this block
 * there are a header (header_t).
